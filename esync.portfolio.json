    "story": "eSync was born from a simple observation: Zambian schools struggled with fragmented systems that didn't work together. Teachers used one tool for attendance, another for grades, finance teams used spreadsheets, and parents were left in the dark. We knew there had to be a better way. Built by education-focused technologists who understand the African school environment, eSync combines powerful features with the reliability and simplicity that Zambian schools need. Today, we're proud to partner with schools across the region to transform education through technology."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What happens if the internet goes down?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is my school's data secure?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can we import existing student data?",
      "answer": "Yes. We support Excel and CSV imports for students, staff, classes, and subjects. Our onboarding team will assist with data mapping, validation, and clean migration to ensure accuracy. The import process is typically completed within 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the minimum technical requirements?",
      "answer": "eSync works on any device with a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Minimum internet: 1 Mbps for basic operations. Mobile access requires Android 6+ or iOS 12+. No software installation required—everything is browser-based and cloud-hosted."

    },
    {
      "question": "Can we customise eSync for our school?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What if we have more than 1000 students?",
      "answer": "eSync handles schools of any size with no student limits. Performance remains fast and reliable whether you have 50 or 5000 students. Pricing is the same regardless of school size—one fair plan for all Zambian schools."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do parents get access to their child's information?",
      "answer": "Parents get a web portal. Teachers/admins can share announcements, attendance updates, grades, and fee balances in real-time. Parents receive SMS and in-app notifications about important updates and can communicate directly with teachers through the platform."
    },
    {
      "question": "What payment methods do you accept?",
      "answer": "We accept Zambian bank transfers, mobile money (MTN Money, Airtel Money). You can pay monthly, per term, per semester, or annually. Quarterly billing is also available for larger schools."
