Teachers spent hours on paperwork instead of preparing lessons. Administrators manually tracked fees with spreadsheets prone to errors. Parents had no way to know their children's progress.",

It needed a solution designed specifically for Zambian schools—one that works on any device, survives on slow internet, respects tight budgets, and solves real problems. eSync was born."
