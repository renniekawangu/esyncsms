    "story": "eSync was born from a simple observation: Zambian schools struggled with fragmented systems that didn't work together. Teachers used one tool for attendance, another for grades, finance teams used spreadsheets, and parents were left in the dark. We knew there had to be a better way. Built by education-focused technologists who understand the African school environment, eSync combines powerful features with the reliability and simplicity that Zambian schools need. Today, we're proud to partner with schools across the region to transform education through technology."
