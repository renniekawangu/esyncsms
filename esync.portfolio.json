      "answer": "eSync is built specifically for Zambian schools. It understands local curriculum requirements, Zambian fee structures, and works perfectly on low-bandwidth connections common in Zambia. Plus, it's more affordable than international alternatives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can multiple users access the system simultaneously?",
      "answer": "Yes! eSync supports unlimited concurrent users. Teachers, admin, parents, and students can all access the system at the same time. Role-based access ensures everyone sees only what they're supposed to see."
